Description: "With QRemoteControl installed on your Smartphone you can easily control
  your computer via WiFi. By using the touchpad of your Phone you can for example
  open the internet browser and navigate to the pages you want to visit, use the music
  player or your media center without being next to your PC or laptop. Summurazing
  QRemoteControl allows you to do almost everything you would be able to do with a
  mouse and a keyboard, but also from a greater distance.  To make these replacements
  possible QRemoteControl offers you a touchpad, a keyboard, multimedia keys and buttons
  for starting applications.  Even powering on the computer via Wake On Lan is supported
  by this app.\nThe fresh design makes QRemoteControl an eyecatcher. Moreover serveral
  color designs for the user interface are aviable to adapt it to your individual
  flavour. Automatically swiching from portrait to landscape mode is another feature
  making it pefectly fiting for the user in every situation.\n\nBy now the server
  application is available for Windows, Linux and Mac."
